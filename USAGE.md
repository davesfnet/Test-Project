# Introduction
When you customize Magento to your needs, conversion is everything. So part of the customization process will definitely include the checkout process, including the success page that is visited once the checkout is completed. But when you refresh the success page, the session is cleaned up and you are redirected back to the cart.

This extension is ment to solve this specific issue. Instead of hacking the Magento core, you can install our Magento extension in a simple and clean manner, and preview the success-page at any time. You simply point your browser to the preview URL and voila, there's your success page:

    http://MAGENTO/checkouttester/index/success

You can also test a specific order with the following:

    http://MAGENTO/checkouttester/index/success/order_id/1234

# Tip
If you like this extension, make sure to view our Email Tester extension. We do not want to build a shop without it.

# Magento 2 extension available
Please note that this extension is only available under Magento 1 (which is by now a deprecated platform that you should move away from). We have released a new extension for Magento 2, which is listed on our extensions page.
